# DerivativeRodeo

“This ain’t my first rodeo.” (an idiomatic American slang for “I’m prepared for what comes next.”)

The `DerivativeRodeo` "moves" files from one storage location (e.g. *input*) to one or more storage locations (e.g. *output*) via a generator.

- [Storage Location](./lib/derivative_rodeo/storage_locations/base_location.rb) :: where we can expect to find a file.
- [Generator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/base_generator.rb) :: a process to transform a file into another file.

## Process Life Cycle

In the case of a *input* storage location (e.g. `input_location`), we expect that the underlying file pointed at by the *input* storage location exists.  After all we can't move what we don't have.

In the case of a *output* storage location (e.g. `output_location`), we expect that the underlying file will exist after the generator has completed.  The *output* storage location *could* already exist or we might need to generate the file for the *output* location.

There is also the concept of the *pre\_processed* storage location; when the *pre\_processed* storage location exists for the given input, copy that *pre\_processed* file to the *output* location.  And skip running the derivative generator on the *input* storage location.  In other words, if we've already done the derivation elsewhere, use that.

During the generator's process, we need to have a working copy of both the *input* and *output* file.  This is done by creating a temporary file.

In the case of the *input*, the creation of that temporary file involves getting the file from the *input* storage location.  In the case of the *output*, we create a temporary file that the *output* storage location then knows how to move to the resulting place.

![Storage Lifecycle](./artifacts/derivative_rodeo-generator_storage_lifecycle.png)

The above Storage Lifecycle diagram is as follows: `input location` to `input tmp file` to `generator` to `output tmp file` to `output location`.

*Note:* We've designed and implemented the data life cycle to automatically clean-up the temporary files as the generator completes.  In this way we can use the smallest working space possible.  A design decision that helps run `DerivativeRodeo` within distributed clusters (e.g. AWS Serverless).

### Common Storage

In this case, <dfn>common storage</dfn> could mean the storage where we're writing all pre-processing of files.  Or it could mean the storage where we're writing for application access (e.g. [Fedora Commons](https://fedora.lyrasis.org) for a [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) application).

In other words, the `DerivativeRodeo` is part of moving files from one location to another, and ensuring that at each step we have all of the expected files we want.

### Related Files

This is not strictly related to <dfn>Hyrax's FileSet</dfn>, that is a set of files in which one is considered the original and all others are _derivatives_ of the original.

However it is helpful to think in those terms; files that have a significant relation to each other; one derived from the other.  For example an original PDF and it's extracted text would be two significantly related files.

</details>

Given a single original file in a previous home, we are copying that original file (and derivatives) to various locations:

- From previous home to S3.
- From S3 to local temporary storage (for processing).
- Create a derivative temporary file based on existing file.
- Copying derivative temporary file to S3.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'derivative-rodeo'
```

(Due to historical reasons the gem name is `derivative-rodeo` even though the repository is `derivative_rodeo`.  The following "require" methods will work:

- `require 'derivative_rodeo'`
- `require 'derivative-rodeo'`
- `require 'derivative/rodeo'`

And then execute: `$ bundle install`

Be aware that you need `pdfinfo` command line tool installed for this gem to run specs or when using PDF functionality.

## Usage

TODO

## Technical Overview of the DerivativeRodeo

### Generators

Generators are responsible for ensuring that we have the file associated with the generator.  For example, the [HocrGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/hocr_generator.rb) is responsible for ensuring that we have the `.hocr` file in the expected desired storage location.

#### Interface(s)

Generators must have an initializer and build command:

- `.new(array_of_file_urls, output_location_template, preprocessed_location_template)`
- `#generated_files` (executes the generators actions) and returns array of files
- `#generated_uris` (executes the generators actions) and returns array of output uris

#### Supported Generators

Below is the current list of generators.

- [HocrGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/hocr_generator.rb) :: generated tesseract files from images, also creates monocrhome files as a prestep
- [MonochromeGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/monochrome_generator.rb) :: converts images to monochrome
- [CopyGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/copy_generator.rb) :: sends a set of uris to another location. For example from <abbr title="Simple Storage Service">S3</abbr> to <abbr title="Simple Queue Service">SQS</abbr> or from filesystem to S3.
- [PdfSplitGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/pdf_split_generator.rb) :: split a PDF into one image per page
- [WordCoordinatesGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/word_coordinates_generator.rb) :: create a JSON file representing the words and coordinates (derived from the `.hocr` file).

#### Registered Generators

TODO: We want to expose a list of registered generators

### Storage Locations

Storage locations are where we put things.  Each location has a specific implementation but is expected to inherit from the  [DerivativeRodeo::StorageLocation::BaseLocation](./lib/derivative_rodeo/storage_adapters/base_adapter.rb).

`DerivativeRodeo::StorageLocation::BaseLocation.locations` method tracks the registered locations.

The location represents where the file *should* be.

#### Supported Storage Locations

Storage locations follow a [URI pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Example_URIs)

- `file://` :: “local” file system storage
- `s3://` :: <abbr title="Amazon Web Service">AWS</abbr>’s <abbr title="Simple Storage Service">S3</abbr> storage system
- `sqs://` :: <abbr title="Amazon Web Service">AWS</abbr>’s <abbr title="Simple Queue Service">SQS</abbr>

#### Templates

Throughout the code you'll see reference to the following concepts:

- `input_location_template`
- `output_location_template`
- `preprocessed_location_template`

In [Process Life Cycle](#process-life-cycle) we discussed the `input_location`, `output_location`, and `preprocessed_location`.  The concept of the template provides a flexibility in mapping a location to another location

Examples of mapping one file path to another are:

- I want to copy `https://hello.com/world/GUID/file.jpg` to `file:///tmp/GUID/file.jpg`.
- I want to transform `file:///tmp/GUID/file.jpg` to `file:///tmp/GUID/file.hocr`; that is run OCR on an image and write a `.hocr` file.
- I want to use the `file:///tmp/GUID/file.hocr` to generate a `file:///tmp/GUID/file.coordinates.json`; that is convert the HOCR file to a coordinates.json file.

See [DerivativeRodeo::Service::ConvertUriViaTemplateService](./lib/derivative_rodeo/services/convert_uri_via_template_service.rb) for more details.

## Development

- Checkout the repository: `git clone https://github.com/scientist-softserv/derivative_rodeo`
- Install dependencies: `cd derivative_rodeo; bundle install`
- Install git hooks: `rake install_hooks`
- Install binaries:
  - `pdfinfo`: provided by poppler (e.g. `brew install poppler`)
  - GhostScript (e.g. `gs`): run `brew install gs`

Then go about writing your code and documentation.

The git hooks call `rake default` which will:

- Amend the table of contents of this file
- Run `rubocop`
- Validate yard documentation (see http://rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/Tags.md#List_of_Available_Tags for help correcting warnings)
- Run `rspec` with `simplecov`

### Logging in Test Environment

Throughout the `DerivativeRodeo` we log some activity.  In the typical test run, the logs are overly chatty.  If you want the more chatty logs run the following: `DEBUG=t rspec`.
