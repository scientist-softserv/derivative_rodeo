# DerivativeRedeo

“This ain’t my first rodeo.” (an idiomatic American slang for “I’m prepared for what comes next.”)

The `DerivativeRodeo` provides a means of assembling a set of derivatives into a _common storage_ location by:

- Checking if it already exists in the _common storage_.
- Fetching it if exists elsewhere and writing it to the _common storage_.
- Generating the derivative into the _common storage_.

### Common Storage

In this case, <dfn>common storage</dfn> could mean the storage where we're writing all pre-processing of files.  Or it could mean the storage where we're writing for application access (e.g. [Fedora Commons](https://fedora.lyrasis.org) for a [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) application).

In other words, the `DerivativeRodeo` is part of moving files from one location to another, and ensuring that at each step we have all of the expected files we want.

### Related Files

This is not strictly related to <dfn>Hyrax's FileSet</dfn>, that is a set of files in which one is considered the original and all others are _derivatives_ of the original. 

However it is helpful to think in those terms; files that have a significant relation to each other; one derived from the other.  For example an original PDF and it's extracted text would be two significantly related files.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'derivative_rodeo'
```

And then execute: `$ bundle install`

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Technical Overview of the DerivativeRodeo

### Generators

Generators are responsible for ensuring that we have the file associated with the generator.  For example, the [HocrGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/hocr_generator.rb) is responsible for ensuring that we have the `.hocr` file in the expected desired storage location.

#### Interface(s)

Generators must have an initializer and build command:

- `.new(array_of_file_urls, output_url_type, preprocessor_url_type)`
- `#generated_files` (executes the generators actions) and returns array of files
- `#generated_uris` (executes the generators actions) and returns array of output uris

#### Supported Generators

Below is the current list of generators.

- [HocrGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/hocr_generator.rb) :: generated tesseract files from images, also creates monocrhome files as a prestep
- [MonochromeGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/monochrome_generator.rb) :: converts images to monochrome
- [MoveGenerator](./lib/derivative_rodeo/generators/move_generator.rb) :: sends a set of uris to another location. For example from <abbr title="Simple Storage Service">S3</abbr> to <abbr title="Simple Queue Service">SQS</abbr> or from filesystem to S3.

#### Registered Generators

TODO: We want to expose a list of registered generators

### Storage Adapters

Storage adapters are where we put things.  Each adapter has a specific implementation but is expected to inherit from the  [DerivativeRedeo::StorageAdapter::BaseAdapter](./lib/derivative_rodeo/storage_adapters/base_adapter.rb).

`DerivativeRedeo::StorageAdapter::BaseAdapter.adapters` method tracks the registered adapters.

#### Supported Storage Adapters

Storage adapters follow a [URI pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Example_URIs)

- `file://` :: “local” file system storage
- `s3://` :: <abbr title="Amazon Web Service">AWS</abbr>’s <abbr title="Simple Storage Service">S3</abbr> storage system
- `sqs://` :: <abbr title="Amazon Web Service">AWS</abbr>’s <abbr title="Simple Queue Service">SQS</abbr>

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
